## Title

**Neighborhood Atlas 2015**

## Description
The Neighborhood Atlas website was created in order to freely share measures of neighborhood disadvantage with the public, including educational institutions, health systems, not-for-profit organizations, and government agencies, in order to make these metrics available for use in research, program planning, and policy development. The site was launched May 1, 2018.

**Area Deprivation Index (ADI):** It is based on a measure created by the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) thirty years ago. It helps to rank neighborhoods on the basis of  income, education, employment, and housing quality.
