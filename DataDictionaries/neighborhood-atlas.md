## Methods Variables

### Area Deprivation and Widening Inequalities in US Mortality, 1969-1998
A census-based area deprivation index was linked to county mortality data.

### Neighborhood Socioeconomic Disadvantage and 30-day Rehospitalization
Medicare data were linked to 2000 census data to construct an ADI for each patient's census block group, which were then sorted into percentiles by increasing ADI. Relationships between neighborhood ADI grouping and 30-day rehospitalization were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for patient sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions and severity, and index hospital characteristics.

## Data Variables

GISJOIN: Key linkage field to the block group shapefile served by NHGIS

FIPS: The block group Census ID

ADI_NATRANK: National percentile of block group ADI score

ADI_STATERNK: State-specific decile of block group ADI score
