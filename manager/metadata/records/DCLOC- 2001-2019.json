    "This dataset provides modeled predictions of ozone levels from the EPA's Downscaler model. These data are used by the CDC's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network to generate air quality measures. Data are at the county levels for 2001-2014. The dataset includes the maximum, median, mean, and population-weighted mean concentration."
