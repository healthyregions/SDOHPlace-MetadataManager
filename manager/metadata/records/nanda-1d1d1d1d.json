    "This dataset contains measures of street connectivity (how well streets connect with one another) within all United States ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTAs). This includes measures of the number of street segments (links) and intersections (nodes) per ZCTA, street length within ZCTA, and indices representing overall connectivity within the ZCTA."
