    "\"To help planners prioritize where to address park access gaps first, TPL provides a prioritization index for all populated areas that are not within a 10-minute walk to a park. The prioritization index is calculated for census block groups and is based on a comprehensive index of six equally weighted demographic and environmental metrics. The six variables are: 1. Population density 2. Density of low-income households... 3. Density of people of color 4. Community health... 5. Urban heat islands... 6. Pollution burden\""
