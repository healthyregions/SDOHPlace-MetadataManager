    "This study contains two data files.  Data file one (<strong>Broadband Internet Availability, Speed, and Adoption by Census Tract</strong>) contains measures of broadband internet availability, speed, and adoption per United States census tract in 2014 through 2020. The data is derived from internet service providers' Form 477 reports to the Federal Communications Commission.  Data file two (<strong>Broadband Internet Availability and Speed by ZIP Code Tabulation Area</strong>) contains measures of broadband internet access and usage per United States ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA) in 2014 through 2020. The data is derived primarily from internet service providers' Form 477 reports to the Federal Communications Commission."
