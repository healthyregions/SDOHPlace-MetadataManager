    "The New York City Community Health Profiles capture the health of 59 community districts across the city. They contain over 50 measures of neighborhood health, emphasizing that our health starts where we live, work and play. With these profiles, you can learn more about your neighborhood and compare it to other communities in NYC. For example, you can choose your neighborhood and find out how many streets have bike lanes or what percentage of adults have diabetes. You can use this information to advocate for improving and investing in the health of your community."
