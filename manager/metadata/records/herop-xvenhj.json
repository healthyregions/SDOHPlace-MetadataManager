    "The goal of EJScreen is to find places at the census block group level that could have greater environmental burdens, highlighting specific populations that may be at risk. The tool also allows users to obtain environmental and demographic information all over the U.S.A, at high spatial resolution, shown with color-coded maps and standard data reports."
