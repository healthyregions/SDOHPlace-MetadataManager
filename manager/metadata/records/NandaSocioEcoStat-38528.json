  "description": [
    "These datasets contain measures of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics by US census tract for the years 2000-2020 and ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA) for the years 2008-2020. Example measures include population density; population distribution by race, ethnicity, age, and income; income inequality by race and ethnicity; and proportion of population living below the poverty level, receiving public assistance, and female-headed or single parent families with kids. The datasets also contain a set of theoretically derived measures capturing neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and affluence, as well as a neighborhood index of Hispanic, foreign born, and limited English."
