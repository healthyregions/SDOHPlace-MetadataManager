    "EPA developed three data products(Smart Location Database, Access to Jobs and Workers Via Transit Tool, and National Walkability Index) that consistently measure the built environment and transit accessibility of neighborhoods across metropolitan regions and the United States. Users can download data, browse the data in interactive maps, or access the data through web services. The National Walkability Index includes dataset of walkability scores for all block groups as well as the underlying attributes that are used to rank the block groups."
