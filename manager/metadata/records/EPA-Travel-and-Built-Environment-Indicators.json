    "EPA developed three data products(Smart Location Database, Access to Jobs and Workers Via Transit Tool, and National Walkability Index) that consistently measure the built environment and transit accessibility of neighborhoods across metropolitan regions and the United States. Users can download data, browse the data in interactive maps, or access the data through web services. Smart Location Database includes more than 90 attributes summarizing characteristics such as housing density, diversity of land use, neighborhood design, destination accessibility, transit service, employment, and demographics. Coverage is limited to metropolitan regions served by transit agencies that share their service data in a standard format called GTFS"
