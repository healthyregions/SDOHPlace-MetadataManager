    "The Global Streetscapes dataset is an open-access, enriched dataset designed to advance the use of street-level imagery in urban science research. It includes data from 688 cities worldwide, ensuring a geographically and demographically balanced representation. The dataset of 10 million street-level images was created by sampling street-level images from a wide range of cities and enriching them through computer vision and geospatial analysis. This process enhances the images with 346 attributes, providing geographical, temporal, contextual, semantic, and perceptual information. The dataset is crowdsourced, relying on open imagery from Mapillary and KartaView. To improve integration with other datasets, images are geolocated and merged with global geospatial datasets. Additional temporal attributes are calculated based on the captured timestamps, offering valuable insights for urban research. The dataset is openly available alongside the source code, enabling researchers to explore and apply street view imagery data in diverse urban studies."

    "Warning: Some attribute measures, such as perception, should be interpreted as subjective. Read method documentation for a complete understanding of approach.",
    "Since the imagery comes from crowdsourcing platforms (Mapillary and KartaView), the dataset may have variations in image quality and coverage. The data might be uneven in some areas, depending on how much imagery is available in a specific location. The dataset provides metadata about each image, but the images themselves are not included."
