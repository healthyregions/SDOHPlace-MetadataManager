    "The <a href='https://www.neighborhoodatlas.medicine.wisc.edu'>Neighborhood Atlas website</a> was created in order to freely share measures of neighborhood disadvantage with the public, including educational institutions, health systems, not-for-profit organizations, and government agencies, in order to make these metrics available for use in research, program planning, and policy development. The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is based on a measure created by the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) thirty years ago. It helps to rank neighborhoods on the basis of income, education, employment, and housing quality."

Relationships between neighborhood ADI grouping and 30-day rehospitalization were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for patient sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions and severity, and index hospital characteristics.\r\n\r\n### ADI\r\n\r\nThe ADIs on this website are provided in national percentile rankings at the block group level from 1 to 100. The percentiles are constructed by ranking the ADI from low to high for the nation and grouping the block groups/neighborhoods into bins corresponding to each 1% range of the ADI. Group 1 is the lowest ADI and group 100 is the highest ADI. A block group with a ranking of 1 indicates the lowest level of \"disadvantage\" within the nation and an ADI with a ranking of 100 indicates the highest level of \"disadvantage\".",
